    <h3>My favorite Activity is Cooking.</h3>
    <p>When you’re cooking you get to choose what you make AND what goes into each dish. You also get to choose the<b> quality of the ingredients</b>. So it’s easy to make things that are the <b>most delicious</b> to you.

        Love chilli (like I do)? Then add more. Love sharp, acidic flavours (like I do)? Then add a splash of vinegar or a squeeze of lemon.
        
        Think of it as a choose your own (tasty) adventure.</p>
